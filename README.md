# CatSched Dashboard

## About

This repo contains all code needed for the CatSched Dashboard, an R Shiny project that uses the CatSched API to retrieve data about prospective course schedules and visualize them. The goal is for faculty members (particularly department chairs) to be able to understand the how dispersed their class schedules appear to be for the upcoming academic year, and use that information to spread out their sections so the overall college schedule is somewhat evenly distributed throughout any given week of a given semester.

## Authors

- Pete Benbow (Dept of Data Science)

## Future plans

- Set up GitHub actions to automatically deploy this dashboard to a production Shiny environment like shinyapps.io or an internal college server, or run it in serverless mode via the `shinylive` package.
