# CatSched Dashboard

This repo contains all code needed for the CatSched Dashboard, an R Shiny project that uses the CatSched API to retrieve data about prospective course schedules and visualize them. The goal is for faculty members (particularly department chairs) to be able to understand the how dispersed their class schedules appear to be for the upcoming academic year, and use that information to spread out their sections so the overall college schedule is somewhat evenly distributed throughout any given week of a given semester.
